	<p>
		This Maya plugin gives users the ability to have bounding sphere collision 
		detection within large, Maya Particle Systems. Each particle is given a randomized 
		set velocity at the beginning of the plugin. The collisions occur within a NxN 
		bounding box (cube). We decided to solve this problem using threading, vectorization, 
		and offloading because the high amount of floating point operations and the pure nature of the algorithm is vastly intensive. From the results and details below, we succeeded in optimizing this problem getting as high as a 7x speedup.

<!------------------------------------ What We Did ------------------------>

<div class="section" id="details">

	<h2>Problem Details</h2>
	<h3>Algorithm</h3>
   <p>
      The current vertex position of each particle is passed to the collision detection algorithm, along with their initial velocities and allocated memory for storing the resulting velocities. These data are passed in SOA form. The algorithm checks the distance of each particle to every other particle to determine if a collision has occured with the particle that is being checked. This results in an O(N^2) operations. The algorithm also checks if the particle has reached the limits of a bounding box, and in such a case, the particle rebounds off the plane.

      If a collision has occured, the resulting velocity is calculated and stored in the resulting velocity array. If a collision has not occured with a particle, its initial velocity is saved in the resulting velocity array.
   </p>

   <h3>Maya API</h3>
   <p>
      We decided to implement our plugin in Maya using Maya's Particle System.
      To do this, our class inherited from the MPxCommand; however, this had some 
      unexpected side effects. One of the major side effects we spent a lot of time 
      fixing was getting Maya to keep calling our "doIt" function per frame. Inheritely, 
      Maya only calls a MPxCommand once because typically commands are only done once 
      and then undone or redone otherwise. We overcomed this problem by using the 
      mel command:<br>
      <center><i>"expression -string "COMMAND_NAME"</i></center>
      <br>This solved our problem, but the new side effect of this was that Maya 
      would now create new instances of our class per frame! We finally just dealt 
      with this side effect and made sure we initialized our velocities in unique 
      situations (e.g. when the velocities are <0.0, 0.0, 0.0> for instance).

   </p>

   <h3>Threading</h3>
   <p>
      Threading collision detection is as simple as putting #pragma parallels around 
      the for loop region. We did not encounter many race conditions; however, if 
      we decided to have pure collision detection, we would have a race condition if 
      three or more spheres collided at once.<br>One race condition we did have for 
      awhile was when we tried to update two spheres on one pass of the outer for loop 
      region of our algorithm. For instance:<br>
      <center><i>"for (int i = 0; i < numSpheres; ++i) {<br>
           for (int j = 0; j < numSpheres; ++j) { ...."</i></center>

     	If we updated every instance in the inner for loop, other threads would be 
     	racing to update that same information. This is a typical race condition. 
     	We fixed this by only updating the out for loop iteration since it would 
     	only be done once.
   </p>

   <h3>Vectorization</h3>
   <p>
      We tested each vectoriaztion pragma to determine which would give us the most speedup. We found that our plugin runs fastest when #pragma simd is used. We were surprised by this result because the opt report showed that all of our data had unalighed access. SIMD had about a 3x speedup over novector when collisions between 100,000 particles were being checked. We found that vectorization of smaller sample sizes had an insigificant affect.<br>
      Furthermore, we included the use of <i>"__builtin_expect"</i> for when a sphere would 
      collide with the cube walls. We deemed this a rare case to hit the outer walls since 
      there is a larger area of movement within the cube. By expecting the sphere to be 
      within the inner part of the cube, we allowed the compiler to optimize our code for 
      the better.

   <h2>Problems Encountered</h2>
   <p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Maya API - Specifically getting the particle system to work correctly.</li>
      	<li>Vectorization - Unaligned data by nature of the algorithm</li>
      	<li>Collision Detection - Working around maya positions</li>
      	<li>Reusing Data - Difficult because Maya does too much work.</li>
      </ul>
   </p>

<div class="section" id="future">
   <h2>What We Wish We Could Have Done</h2>
   <p>
      If we had more time to work on this plugin, we would have liked to arrange our data so that we had aligned access, refined the collision detection algorithm for more accurate collision responses, utilized the Retain and Reuse functionality of offloading, test our speedup with the use of 2 Xeon Phi cards, and implementated the changing color functionality of particles when they collide.
